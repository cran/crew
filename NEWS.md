# crew 0.0.5

* Write a `call()` method to make it easier to write custom launcher plugins.
* Add robust documentation and tests for custom launcher plugins.

* Remove the `seconds_poll_high` and `seconds_poll_low` fields and arguments for compatibility with `mirai` development and release versions.
* Hard-code the `async_dial` field in the router for compatibility with `mirai` development and release versions.
